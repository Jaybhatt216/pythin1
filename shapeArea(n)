Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. 
An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, 
side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.
For n = 2, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 13.

the question tries to trick people the easiest way I see it is focus on the example, and see if you can detect a pattern 
'''
def shapeArea(n):
    return n**2+ (n-1)**2 #  n squared plus n-1 squared usually gives the right answer, 2**2 = 4, 2-1 = 1 ** 1 = 1, 4 +1 = 5, same for 13 and so on
